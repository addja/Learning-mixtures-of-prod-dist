# Learning-mixtures-of-prod-dist
My Msc dissertation topic is about learning mixtures of product distributions from sampled data. In this repo I'll add my implementations of current state of the art algorithms that tackle this problem and maybe later my trials to improve them.

Files:
  - main.py: execution file that manages the execution workflow
  - pd.py: functions related to product distributions
  - fm.py: implementation of the Freund Mansour algorithm
  - sfod.py: implementation of the Serveido Feldman O'Donnell algorithm
